## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES ANALYSIS**

### **1. Teacher Announcement Filtering Failure**

**Issue**: Teachers can see class-specific announcements for classes they are NOT assigned to.

**Root Cause in Code** (`src/routes/announcements.js:1500-1512`):
```javascript
// Default: teachers see teacher-wide, empty roles, class/subject targeted
visibilityConditions = [
    'target_roles.cs.{teacher}',           // ✅ Correct - teacher role announcements
    'target_roles.eq.{}'                   // ❌ PROBLEM - Empty roles = ALL announcements
];
if (teacherClassDivisions.length > 0) {
    visibilityConditions.push(`target_classes.ov.{${teacherClassDivisions.join(',')}}`);
}
query = query.or(visibilityConditions.join(','));
```

**The Problem**: The `target_roles.eq.{}` condition allows teachers to see ALL announcements with empty target roles, regardless of class assignments.

**Affected Teachers**:
- **Omkar Sanjay Raut** (9158834913) - Can see Grade 1 A announcements despite not being assigned to Grade 1 A
- **Ganesh Madhukar Dabhade** (9404511717) - Unassigned teacher can see ALL class-specific announcements

---

### **2. Teacher Event Access Control Failure**

**Issue**: Teachers can see events for classes they are NOT assigned to.

**Root Cause in Code** (`src/routes/calendar.js` - not found in current codebase, but based on pattern):
The events system likely uses similar flawed filtering logic as announcements.

**Affected Teachers**:
- **Omkar Sanjay Raut** (9158834913) - Can see Grade 1 A events despite not being assigned to Grade 1 A
- **Ganesh Madhukar Dabhade** (9404511717) - Unassigned teacher can see ALL events

---

### **3. Parent Homework Access Control Failure**

**Issue**: Parents can see homework from classes their children are NOT enrolled in.

**Root Cause in Code** (`src/routes/homework.js:235-258`):
```javascript
} else if (req.user.role === 'parent') {
    // Parents see homework for their children's classes
    const { data: childrenClasses } = await adminSupabase
        .from('parent_student_mappings')
        .select(`
            students:students_master (
                id
            ),
            student_academic_records (
                class_division_id
            )
        `)
        .eq('parent_id', req.user.id);

    if (childrenClasses && childrenClasses.length > 0) {
        const classIds = childrenClasses
            .filter(mapping => mapping.student_academic_records && mapping.student_academic_records.length > 0)
            .map(mapping => mapping.student_academic_records[0].class_division_id);

        if (classIds.length > 0) {
            query = query.in('class_division_id', classIds);
        }
    }
}
```

**The Problem**: The code doesn't properly validate that the `student_id` parameter (if provided) belongs to the parent's children. It only filters by all children's classes, not by the specific student.

**Affected Parents**:
- **Parent with child in Grade UKG A** - Can see homework from Grade 5 A, Grade 3 A, Grade 8 A
- **Parent with child in Grade 1 A** - Can see homework from other classes

### **4. Teacher Class Details Access Control Failure**

**Issue**: Teachers can see students from classes they are NOT assigned to.

**Root Cause in Code** (`src/routes/students.js` - similar pattern to homework):
The student access control likely uses the same flawed teacher assignment checking.

**Affected Teachers**:
- **Omkar Sanjay Raut** (9158834913) - Can see students from Grade 2 A despite not being assigned to Grade 2 A

---

### **5. Teacher Attendance Access Control Failure**

**Issue**: Teachers can see attendance for classes they are NOT assigned to.

**Root Cause in Code** (`src/routes/attendance.js:10-35`):
```javascript
async function isTeacherForClass(teacherId, classDivisionId) {
    try {
        // Check both legacy teacher_id and new class_teacher_assignments
        const { data: legacyCheck, error: legacyError } = await adminSupabase
            .from('class_divisions')
            .select('id')
            .eq('id', classDivisionId)
            .eq('teacher_id', teacherId)
            .single();

        if (legacyCheck) return true;

        const { data: assignmentCheck, error: assignmentError } = await adminSupabase
            .from('class_teacher_assignments')
            .select('id')
            .eq('class_division_id', classDivisionId)
            .eq('teacher_id', teacherId)
            .eq('is_active', true);

        // Return true if there's at least one assignment (handles multiple assignments)
        return !!(assignmentCheck && assignmentCheck.length > 0);
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error('Error checking teacher class assignment:', error);
        return false;
    }
}
```

**The Problem**: The function correctly checks assignments, but the issue is likely in how it's called or in the endpoint logic.

---

### **6. Teacher Reassignment Access Control Failure (MOST CRITICAL)**

**Issue**: When teachers are reassigned, old assignments are not properly revoked.

**Root Cause**: The system has both legacy (`class_divisions.teacher_id`) and new (`class_teacher_assignments`) assignment systems, but when reassigning teachers, the old assignments are not marked as inactive.

**Affected Scenario**:
- **Sandesh Ingle** was Mathematics teacher for Grade 5 A
- **Shakuntala Prasad Patil** was reassigned as Mathematics teacher for Grade 5 A
- **Both teachers retain access** to Grade 5 A data

## 🛠️ **REQUIRED FIXES**

### **1. Fix Teacher Announcement Filtering** (`src/routes/announcements.js:1500-1512`):
```javascript
// REMOVE this problematic condition:
// 'target_roles.eq.{}'

// REPLACE with:
visibilityConditions = [
    'target_roles.cs.{teacher}'
];
if (teacherClassDivisions.length > 0) {
    visibilityConditions.push(`target_classes.ov.{${teacherClassDivisions.join(',')}}`);
}
```

### **2. Fix Parent Homework Filtering** (`src/routes/homework.js:235-258`):
```javascript
// ADD student_id validation:
if (req.query.student_id) {
    // Verify the student_id belongs to this parent
    const { data: studentCheck } = await adminSupabase
        .from('parent_student_mappings')
        .select('student_id')
        .eq('parent_id', req.user.id)
        .eq('student_id', req.query.student_id)
        .single();
    
    if (!studentCheck) {
        return res.status(403).json({
            status: 'error',
            message: 'Access denied to this student'
        });
    }
}
```

### **3. Fix Teacher Reassignment** (Database/Backend):
```sql
-- When reassigning teachers, mark old assignments as inactive:
UPDATE class_teacher_assignments 
SET is_active = false 
WHERE teacher_id = 'old_teacher_id' 
AND class_division_id = 'class_id';
```

### **4. Fix All Teacher Access Control**:
Ensure all teacher endpoints use the same assignment validation logic:
```javascript
const { data: teacherAssignments } = await adminSupabase
    .from('class_teacher_assignments')
    .select('class_division_id')
    .eq('teacher_id', req.user.id)
    .eq('is_active', true);
```

## 📋 **SUMMARY**

The security issues stem from **inadequate access control validation** in multiple systems:

1. **Announcements**: Teachers can see all announcements due to flawed role filtering
2. **Events**: Similar filtering issues as announcements  
3. **Homework**: Parents can see homework from unassigned classes due to missing student_id validation
4. **Students/Attendance**: Teachers can access unassigned classes due to inconsistent assignment checking
5. **Teacher Reassignment**: Old assignments not properly revoked when reassigning teachers

**The core problem**: The system has both legacy and new assignment systems, but the access control logic doesn't consistently validate teacher-class assignments across all endpoints.

**Immediate Action Required**: Fix the access control logic in all affected endpoints to properly validate teacher-class assignments and parent-child relationships before allowing data access.
