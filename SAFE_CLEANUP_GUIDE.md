# 🛡️ Safe Test User Cleanup Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Why Wildcards Are Dangerous

### ❌ **NEVER DO THIS:**

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE phone_number LIKE '8888%';  -- DANGEROUS!
DELETE FROM users WHERE phone_number LIKE '7777%';  -- DANGEROUS!
```

### 🚨 **Why It's Dangerous:**

You have **REAL parents** with similar phone numbers:

- `8888101093` - Dnyaneshwar Namdev Sahane (REAL parent)
- `8888779023` - Sambhaji Dattatray Balap (REAL parent)
- `8888138341` - Real teacher
- And potentially more...

Wildcard deletion would **DELETE REAL USERS**! 😱

## ✅ **Safe Cleanup Methods**

### **Method 1: Delete by Exact IDs (SAFEST)**

This is the **most precise** method. Use the IDs from your test run:

```sql
-- STEP 1: PREVIEW (verify these are test users)
SELECT
    id,
    phone_number,
    full_name,
    email,
    role,
    created_at
FROM users
WHERE id IN (
    'a5686567-e0df-463d-92ca-aeffffe2fa0d',  -- Test Teacher
    '970aba6a-e972-47ec-8fab-592520983107',  -- Test Parent
    '3a76f089-b1c1-433e-820b-69b587170d50',  -- Test Teacher
    'ebe2699a-071a-4a56-8dd0-3a45c59da2ae'   -- Test Parent
);

-- STEP 2: Verify ALL have full_name = "Test Teacher" or "Test Parent"
-- If ANY real user appears, STOP!

-- STEP 3: If safe, delete
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id IN (
    'a5686567-e0df-463d-92ca-aeffffe2fa0d',
    '970aba6a-e972-47ec-8fab-592520983107',
    '3a76f089-b1c1-433e-820b-69b587170d50',
    'ebe2699a-071a-4a56-8dd0-3a45c59da2ae'
);
```

---

### **Method 2: Filter by Full Name + Email (SAFER)**

Delete users who are clearly test accounts:

```sql
-- STEP 1: PREVIEW
SELECT
    id,
    phone_number,
    full_name,
    email,
    role,
    created_at
FROM users
WHERE
    full_name IN ('Test Teacher', 'Test Parent')
    AND (
        email LIKE '%test.com%'
        OR email LIKE '%@test%'
        OR (email IS NULL AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE)
    );

-- STEP 2: Verify all are test users

-- STEP 3: Delete
DELETE FROM users
WHERE
    full_name IN ('Test Teacher', 'Test Parent')
    AND (
        email LIKE '%test.com%'
        OR (email IS NULL AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE)
    );
```

---

### **Method 3: Delete by Exact Phone Numbers**

If you know the exact phone numbers from your test:

```sql
-- Example: Delete ONLY these specific test phone numbers
DELETE FROM users
WHERE phone_number IN (
    '8888888888',  -- First test teacher
    '7777777777',  -- First test parent
    '8888620657',  -- Second test teacher
    '7777620657'   -- Second test parent
);
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Only use if you're 100% sure these are test numbers!

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

Use **Method 1** (Delete by Exact IDs):

1. ✅ Copy user IDs from test script output
2. ✅ Preview in SELECT query first
3. ✅ Verify ALL are test users
4. ✅ Then DELETE

This is **foolproof** - you can't accidentally delete real users!

---

## 📋 **Your Current Test Users to Delete**

Based on what you showed me:

```sql
-- These are your TEST users (safe to delete):
DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (
    'a5686567-e0df-463d-92ca-aeffffe2fa0d',  -- Test Teacher
    '970aba6a-e972-47ec-8fab-592520983107',  -- Test Parent
    '3a76f089-b1c1-433e-820b-69b587170d50',  -- Test Teacher
    'ebe2699a-071a-4a56-8dd0-3a45c59da2ae'   -- Test Parent
);
```

**⚠️ But first, PREVIEW to be 100% sure:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (
    'a5686567-e0df-463d-92ca-aeffffe2fa0d',
    '970aba6a-e972-47ec-8fab-592520983107',
    '3a76f089-b1c1-433e-820b-69b587170d50',
    'ebe2699a-071a-4a56-8dd0-3a45c59da2ae'
);
```

All should show `full_name = "Test Teacher"` or `"Test Parent"`.

## 🚨 **Real Users to KEEP (Do NOT Delete)**

```sql
-- These are REAL users - DO NOT DELETE!
-- id: 'c29102e4-17b2-40c6-a35c-cbc7bcd0aef8'
-- phone: 8888101093, name: Dnyaneshwar Namdev Sahane

-- id: '66a24ebb-b633-47d2-b9ba-52cf6b479c63'
-- phone: 8888779023, name: Sambhaji Dattatray Balap

-- Any user with:
-- - Real names (not "Test Teacher" or "Test Parent")
-- - initial_password set (these are real parents waiting to register)
-- - Created before today
```

---

## ✅ **Safe Deletion Checklist**

Before running DELETE, verify:

- [ ] Using exact IDs (not wildcards)
- [ ] Previewed with SELECT first
- [ ] All users have "Test" in full_name
- [ ] No real names in the preview
- [ ] Created today (not older)
- [ ] Email contains "test" (if set)

---

## 🔧 **Update All Documentation**

I've updated these files to use safe cleanup:

- ✅ `cleanup_test_users.sql` - Marked as DEPRECATED
- ✅ `cleanup_test_users_SAFE.sql` - Safe method by name/date
- ✅ `cleanup_specific_test_users.sql` - Safest method by ID
- ✅ `DELETE_THESE_TEST_USERS.sql` - Your specific test users
- ✅ `MANUAL_CHAT_TEST_STEPS.md` - Updated cleanup instructions

---

## 🎯 **What to Do Now**

### Cleanup Your Current Test Users:

**Open Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- SAFE deletion by exact ID
DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (
    'a5686567-e0df-463d-92ca-aeffffe2fa0d',
    '970aba6a-e972-47ec-8fab-592520983107',
    '3a76f089-b1c1-433e-820b-69b587170d50',
    'ebe2699a-071a-4a56-8dd0-3a45c59da2ae'
);

-- Verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE full_name = 'Test Teacher' OR full_name = 'Test Parent';
-- Should return 0
```

---

## 💡 **For Future Testing**

Always use **Method 1** (delete by exact ID):

1. Note the user IDs when creating test users
2. Delete using those exact IDs
3. Never use wildcards with phone numbers!
