# Notification Approval Workflow

## üéØ Overview

This document explains how the notification system handles the approval workflow for announcements and events, ensuring parents only receive notifications for approved content.

## üìã Approval Workflow

### **Announcements**

#### **1. Teacher Creates Announcement**

- **Status**: `pending`
- **Notification**: ‚ùå **No notification sent to parents**
- **Reason**: Content needs approval before parents see it

#### **2. Principal/Admin Reviews**

- **Action**: Approve or Reject
- **If Approved**:
  - **Status**: `approved`
  - **Notification**: ‚úÖ **Notifications sent to parents immediately**
  - **Recipients**: All parents based on target roles

#### **3. Principal/Admin Creates Announcement**

- **Status**: `approved` (auto-approved)
- **Notification**: ‚úÖ **Notifications sent to parents immediately**
- **Reason**: Principal/Admin has authority to approve directly

### **Events**

#### **1. Teacher Creates Event**

- **Status**: `pending` (for class-specific events)
- **Notification**: ‚ùå **No notification sent to parents**
- **Reason**: Event needs approval before parents see it

#### **2. Principal/Admin Reviews**

- **Action**: Approve or Reject
- **If Approved**:
  - **Status**: `approved`
  - **Notification**: ‚úÖ **Notifications sent to parents immediately**
  - **Recipients**: Parents of students in targeted classes

#### **3. Principal/Admin Creates Event**

- **Status**: `approved` (auto-approved)
- **Notification**: ‚úÖ **Notifications sent to parents immediately**
- **Reason**: Principal/Admin has authority to approve directly

### **Homework & Classwork**

#### **Teacher Creates Assignment**

- **Status**: `active` (no approval needed)
- **Notification**: ‚úÖ **Notifications sent to parents immediately**
- **Reason**: Homework/classwork doesn't require approval

## üîÑ Notification Triggers

### **When Notifications Are Sent**

| Content Type | Created By      | Status     | Notification Sent? |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Announcement | Teacher         | `pending`  | ‚ùå No              |
| Announcement | Teacher         | `approved` | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| Announcement | Principal/Admin | `approved` | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| Event        | Teacher         | `pending`  | ‚ùå No              |
| Event        | Teacher         | `approved` | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| Event        | Principal/Admin | `approved` | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| Homework     | Teacher         | `active`   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| Classwork    | Teacher         | `active`   | ‚úÖ Yes             |

### **When Notifications Are NOT Sent**

- ‚ùå Pending announcements (waiting for approval)
- ‚ùå Pending events (waiting for approval)
- ‚ùå Rejected announcements/events
- ‚ùå Draft content
- ‚ùå Deleted content

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### **Code Flow**

```javascript
// 1. Content Creation
if (userRole === "teacher") {
  status = "pending"; // Needs approval
} else if (["principal", "admin"].includes(userRole)) {
  status = "approved"; // Auto-approved
}

// 2. Create Content
const content = await createContent({ status, ...data });

// 3. Send Notifications (only if approved)
if (status === "approved") {
  await sendNotifications(content);
}
```

### **Approval Endpoint**

```javascript
// When principal/admin approves content
if (action === "approve") {
  updateData.status = "approved";
  updateData.is_published = true;

  // Send notifications after approval
  await sendNotifications(updatedContent);
}
```

## üì± Parent Experience

### **What Parents See**

1. **Immediate Notifications**: Only for approved content
2. **No Pending Notifications**: Parents don't see content until approved
3. **Real-time Updates**: Instant notifications when content is approved
4. **Complete Information**: All notifications include full content details

### **Notification Content**

```json
{
  "type": "announcement",
  "title": "New Announcement: Parent-Teacher Meeting",
  "message": "There will be a parent-teacher meeting next week...",
  "priority": "normal",
  "data": {
    "announcement_id": "uuid",
    "student_name": "John Doe",
    "student_class": "Grade 5 A"
  }
}
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

### **Content Visibility**

- **Pending Content**: Only visible to creators and approvers
- **Approved Content**: Visible to all intended recipients
- **Rejected Content**: Only visible to creators and approvers

### **Notification Privacy**

- Parents only receive notifications for content they're authorized to see
- Notifications include student context for personalization
- No notifications for content that doesn't apply to their children

## üß™ Testing the Workflow

### **Test Scenarios**

1. **Teacher Creates Pending Announcement**

   ```bash
   # Create as teacher
   POST /api/announcements
   # Expected: No notifications sent
   ```

2. **Principal Approves Announcement**

   ```bash
   # Approve as principal
   PUT /api/announcements/:id/approve
   # Expected: Notifications sent to parents
   ```

3. **Principal Creates Announcement**
   ```bash
   # Create as principal
   POST /api/announcements
   # Expected: Notifications sent immediately
   ```

### **Verification Steps**

1. Check notification count before approval
2. Approve content
3. Check notification count after approval
4. Verify parents received notifications
5. Check notification content and targeting

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### **Metrics to Track**

- **Pending Content**: Count of content waiting for approval
- **Approval Rate**: Percentage of content approved vs rejected
- **Notification Delivery**: Success rate of notification delivery
- **Response Time**: Time from approval to notification delivery

### **Dashboard Views**

- **For Principals**: Pending content requiring approval
- **For Teachers**: Status of their submitted content
- **For Parents**: Real-time notification feed

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **No Notifications After Approval**
   - Check if content is properly approved
   - Verify parent-student mappings exist
   - Check notification service logs

2. **Notifications Sent for Pending Content**
   - Check approval workflow implementation
   - Verify status checks in notification triggers

3. **Missing Parent Notifications**
   - Check target roles and class targeting
   - Verify parent-student relationships
   - Check WebSocket connections

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check content status
GET /api/announcements/:id
